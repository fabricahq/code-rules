# Security practices

Users install Code Rules to download rule libraries into their repositories. Those files become instructions for their coding agents.
**Assume any agent may read imported rules on every invocation.** An unauthorized change could repeatedly influence generated code, tool use, and access to the user's repository.
Security is therefore a core product requirement.

## What we must protect

1. **Rule-file integrity.** Preserve the original bytes of each selected rule version. Detect unauthorized changes to retained files and agent-readable output.
   Generated output may intentionally transform Markdown or apply explicit project overrides; those changes must remain attributable to the selected rules and the user's configuration.
2. **Library-source authenticity.** Fetch the selected repository and exactly the rule versions and commits the project records, or the revision its `ref` names. Never silently substitute another library, version, or commit, or present an unverified origin as authenticated.
   Users must be able to understand which source, library release, and commit supplied each rule.
3. **Our repository and release integrity.** Protect our source, repository access, dependencies, workflows, and published executables against unauthorized changes.
   A compromised importer or release could undermine both rule integrity and source verification across many consuming repositories.

These are requirements to verify, not a claim that an audit has established every guarantee.
A checksum proves consistency with its reference record, not authenticity if an attacker can replace both the content and the record.
Even authentic, unchanged rules can contain harmful instructions. Users must deliberately choose which publishers and rule changes they trust.

Code Rules runs Git on other people's repositories with hooks disabled and only HTTPS and SSH transports allowed. It never shows text from Git, a Git server, or the GitHub CLI, because that text can hold credentials; `internal/gitexec` classifies it privately so callers explain failures with their own messages. The [CLI reference](../docs/src/content/docs/reference/cli.md#text-from-git-servers-and-the-github-cli) states this contract.

## Security audits

Track evidence, confirmed findings, and remaining limitations in these focused audits:

- [CR-3: Rule-file integrity](https://linear.app/ohmygoshjosh/issue/CR-3/audit-rule-file-integrity-from-import-through-agent-readable-output), from imported bytes through the output agents read.
- [CR-4: Library-source authenticity](https://linear.app/ohmygoshjosh/issue/CR-4/audit-rule-library-source-authenticity-and-revision-resolution), including repository identity, Git routing, revision selection, and provenance.
- [CR-5: Repository and release security](https://linear.app/ohmygoshjosh/issue/CR-5/audit-repository-and-release-pipeline-against-supply-chain-compromise), including live access controls and source-to-artifact verification.

The audits must exercise the real CLI or workflow boundaries in controlled fixtures and record the exact commit reviewed.
Dependency scans alone do not establish rule integrity or library authenticity. Treat open audits as unverified work, not completed protection.

## Protecting this repository

We pin dependencies, review updates through Renovate PRs, and scan Go code for known vulnerabilities. Maintainers approve merges; the bot never merges updates automatically.
The controls below reduce the risk of compromising Code Rules itself. Live GitHub settings must enforce the access and review policies alongside the repository configuration.

### Dependency pins

- Pin every external GitHub Action and reusable workflow to its full commit SHA. Keep the release version in a trailing comment for readability.
- Resolve each SHA from the upstream repository, including the commit behind an annotated tag. A version tag alone can move.
- Commit `go.mod` and `go.sum`. Keep Go's checksum verification enabled for public modules.
- Commit `bun.lock` and install website dependencies with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`. Version ranges in `package.json` do not authorize CI to regenerate the lockfile.
- Pin executable tools, including actionlint, Staticcheck, and govulncheck. Avoid `@latest` in CI and release commands.

Pins prevent unexpected changes to selected dependencies. Checksums verify downloaded content. Neither proves that the selected code is safe.

### Renovate update policy

[renovate.json](../renovate.json) owns the executable policy.

| Update | Handling |
| --- | --- |
| Routine patch and minor releases | Open reviewed PRs during Monday's midnight-to-6 a.m. window in `America/Los_Angeles`, after a seven-day release cooldown. |
| Major releases | Propose separate PRs. A maintainer reviews compatibility and migration requirements. |
| Security fixes | Propose PRs on the next bot run, without the weekly window or cooldown. Prioritize review, but require passing checks and manual merging. |
| Action changes | Update the full SHA and its version comment together. Review changes even when the version label stays the same. |

The seven-day cooldown applies to each proposed version, not the time since a package last changed. Missing release timestamps hold routine updates for investigation.
The Dependency Dashboard shows pending updates. Renovate's schedule limits when it can create routine updates; it does not guarantee an exact run time.
Renovate may refresh existing update branches outside that window.

Renovate manages Go modules, Bun workspaces and their lockfile, workflow actions, and supported runtime inputs.
A custom manager finds versioned `go run` tools in workflows and CONTRIBUTING.md commands so those pins receive update PRs too.
The GitHub Actions manager also reads `internal/library/check-workflow.yml`, the workflow `code-rules library init` writes, so its action pins receive update PRs; apply the same update to both workflow examples in the [version rules guide](../docs/src/content/docs/guides/version-rules.md). A test compares its **Check changes in CI** copy with the template; nothing checks the other.
Renovate includes indirect Go requirements. We disable broad lockfile-maintenance runs; dependency PRs regenerate the affected lockfile through the package manager.
Review transitive changes in each lockfile diff: the cooldown does not establish the safety or age of every dependency a package manager resolves.

We constrain TypeScript below 6.1 because Astro check and typescript-eslint require the TypeScript 6 compiler API.
Revisit that constraint when both tools support a newer API. If the constraint blocks a security fix, resolve compatibility as part of the security PR.

### Vulnerability detection

[Dependency security](../.github/workflows/security.yml) runs `govulncheck` on pushes, pull requests, daily at 14:23 UTC, and manual dispatch.
The scan includes tests on Linux and macOS and uses the current Go vulnerability database. Findings and scan errors fail the job.
The [release build](../.github/workflows/build-release.yml) repeats the scan against the exact release source on the release PR, and again if the release is rebuilt after the merge.
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#validate-changes) owns the local command and pinned scanner version.

Scheduled scans run from the default branch after a maintainer merges the workflow. Maintainers must monitor failed runs and GitHub vulnerability alerts.
Scans identify known vulnerabilities in the code they analyze. Passing scans and tests cannot prove that a dependency is free of malicious code or undisclosed vulnerabilities.

Renovate consumes GitHub vulnerability alerts and enables OSV alerts for direct dependencies supported by Renovate.
The experimental OSV integration supplements transitive dependency alerts and govulncheck.
Website dependencies rely on those advisory feeds; govulncheck only analyzes Go code.

### Review and release access

Before merging an update, review its source, release notes, changed permissions or install scripts, and manifest and lockfile diffs.
Confirm all applicable CI checks passed on the current commit. A patch version is not evidence that an update is safe.
For security fixes, verify that the selected version addresses the advisory. Do not bypass failed checks to accelerate a merge.

Workflow permissions default to read-only; the CLI preview downloads workflow also needs `pull-requests: write` to comment. Pull request jobs do not receive publication credentials.
The release build tests the release source and builds its assets without write access or secrets. Only Release Planner's publication job receives permission to write release data, and it runs no repository code.
Actions in that job can access its job token; step-level environment variables do not isolate the token from other actions in the job.
SHA pins and minimal permissions protect against compromised actions as well as compromised publication code.

Dependency updates do not publish releases. A maintainer approves a release by merging its release-note PR, as [Make a release](https://release-planner.fabricahq.com/start-here/release/) describes.
Resolve repository permission restrictions before releasing; do not work around them with a personal token. The protection and environment settings in [GitHub setup](#github-setup-and-activation) authenticate the release workflow and preserve published artifacts; they cannot detect malicious code approved into that workflow.

### PR preview downloads

[Test a PR build](../CONTRIBUTING.md#test-a-pr-build) describes who receives preview links, how to approve one, and how to run a preview safely.

The packaging workflow builds PR code with read-only repository permissions. Successful builds do not establish that the code is safe.
The separate **CLI preview downloads** workflow runs from the default branch and only reads GitHub metadata and posts comments. It never checks out PR code or downloads or runs an artifact.
It checks the approver's current write access, the build's repository, workflow, event, completion and success, and the PR's current head.

Approval advertises a particular preview; it does not approve a release or certify that the code is safe.
Artifacts remain accessible in Actions before promotion; the approval gate controls the bot's download recommendation, not access to the build output.
GitHub artifact digests can detect changed bytes against a trusted reference, but do not establish benign behavior.
Previews are untrusted and are not an installation channel; official release publication remains a separate reviewed process.

### Documentation previews

[Pull request previews](../docs/README.md#pull-request-previews) describes how a pull request's documentation build is published to Cloudflare Pages and who approves it.

The Documentation workflow builds PR code with read-only permissions and no secrets, and uploads the built site as an artifact.
The separate **Documentation previews** workflow runs from the default branch, treats that artifact as data, validates it, and deploys it with wrangler from main's lockfile. It never checks out or runs PR code.
Only its `docs-preview` environment holds the Cloudflare token, admitting `main` only; previews from forks or from authors without write access wait for a maintainer's approval in the `docs-preview-approval` environment. The workflow fails closed if either environment loses its protection.
The token can change every Pages project in Fabrica's account, so it is a dedicated token with only Pages permission and an expiry date, as the Cloudflare unit's README in the infrastructure repository describes.

### GitHub setup and activation

Repository configuration does not install the Renovate GitHub App or enforce these protection and access settings.

1. Grant the [Mend Renovate GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/renovate) access to `fabricahq/code-rules`. Limit its installation to repositories the organization intends it to manage.
2. Keep the dependency graph and GitHub's **Dependabot alerts** enabled. Renovate reads these alerts; Dependabot does not need to create PRs.
3. Leave **Dependabot security updates** disabled and do not add a Dependabot version-update configuration. Renovate owns update PRs.
4. Give Renovate read access to vulnerability alerts and complete its onboarding after this configuration reaches `main`.
5. Verify the Dependency Dashboard lists Go modules, Bun dependencies, actions, runtimes, and all three Go tools. Investigate extraction errors before relying on automation.
6. Use a ruleset or branch protection on `main` to require PRs and the applicable CI checks, and to block deletion and force pushes. Grant Renovate no merge bypass. Review protection separately from the bot's `automerge: false` policy.
7. If administrators need bypass access, set their ruleset bypass mode to **For pull requests only**, never **Always allow**. They can then bypass review requirements through a PR, but cannot push directly.
8. Restrict the `release` and `downstream` environments to the `main` branch, with no reviewers or wait timers.
9. Enable immutable releases so published assets and tags cannot be replaced.

Verify live installation permissions, alert settings, protections, environments, and release settings in GitHub before claiming they are active.
Record dated evidence in the repository security audit instead of relying on a setup snapshot in this document.
