# Code Rules documentation

The [Fabrica Code Rules](https://code-rules.fabricahq.com) website documents the Go CLI and its file formats.

The site uses Astro and Starlight, with human-facing guides, a reference, and a dedicated “For agents” section.
Its visual direction follows [FM Linear's documentation](https://github.com/josh-padnick/fm-linear/tree/main/docs): monochrome typography, generous spacing, and rounded example panels.
The starting design reference is commit `bbb6bb3f1b94d0506120277179128066270f2e3b`.
Shared theme tokens and the accessible-callout transform are adapted from that project.
Homepage content and illustrations are original Code Rules examples; no FM Linear brand imagery is included.

## Run locally

From the repository root:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run docs:dev
```

Use the local URL printed by Astro.

```sh
bun run docs:check
bun run docs:build
bun run docs:links
bun run docs:preview
```

The output is `docs/dist/`.
The rendered-link checker lives in `_tools/link-checker/`. `cli.ts` owns command arguments and exit status; `check-site.ts` coordinates validation. HTML parsing, external requests, public-network restrictions, and their tests stay inside that folder.
The root TypeScript, lint, and test commands include these Bun scripts; Astro checks the site code.
`bun run docs:links` uses Bun and parse5 to check local destinations and fragments in the built HTML.
For a different build directory, run `bun docs/_tools/link-checker/cli.ts <directory>` from the repository root.
The production build includes the search index.
These commands do not publish the site.

## Publishing

The Documentation workflow publishes the site, including `install.sh`, to GitHub Pages at <https://code-rules.fabricahq.com> after a push to `main` passes every docs check, including the external link check. Pull requests and other branches only run the checks.
The site is served at the domain root, and page links are root-relative; do not set Astro's `base`.
GitHub Pages settings, the custom domain, and its DNS record are managed in Fabrica's infrastructure repository, not here.

### Pull request previews

Each pull request's checked build is served on Fabrica's preview host, reachable only from the Fabrica tailnet at `http://<FABRICA_PREVIEW_HOST>:<26000 + PR number mod 500>/`.
A sticky PR comment links it, each push replaces it, and closing the PR tears it down.

The preview host is a self-hosted runner, and this repository is public, so the design keeps PR code off it:

1. The Documentation workflow builds and checks the site on GitHub-hosted runners, then uploads `docs/dist` as the `docs-site` artifact.
2. The Documentation previews workflow (`.github/workflows/docs-preview.yml`) runs from `main`. A GitHub-hosted job decides whether to deploy, and only then do jobs run on the preview host. Those jobs check out `main`, download the artifact, copy it, reject anything but plain files and directories, and serve it with `_tools/docs-preview-server.ts`. Nothing in the artifact is executed.
3. The preview host's runner is the only runner in the `code-rules-docs-previews` runner group. The group admits only this repository and only `.github/workflows/docs-preview.yml` on `refs/heads/main`, so a PR's own workflow cannot reach the host.

The build ran PR code, so its HTML is untrusted. Same-repository PRs from authors with write access get a preview automatically.
Other PRs need a maintainer to review the commit, then run **Documentation previews** from the Actions tab with the successful Documentation run ID and the full commit SHA.

Preview state lives in `~/.code-rules-docs-previews/pr-<N>/` on the host. Previews do not restart after the host reboots; push to the PR to bring one back.
Each deploy also removes previews whose PRs closed while the host was offline.

One-time setup:

- Create the `code-rules-docs-previews` runner group as described above and register the preview host's runner in it.
- Set the `FABRICA_PREVIEW_HOST` repository variable to the host's Tailscale MagicDNS name.

## Maintain the docs

Write pages under `src/content/docs/` in folders matching the sidebar sections: `start-here/`, `concepts/`, `guides/`, `reference/`, and `for-agents/`.
Keep the homepage at `index.mdx` and navigation in `astro.config.mjs` aligned with page slugs. When moving a public page, update links and add a redirect from its old URL.
Homepage composition lives in `src/components/HomePage.astro` and its illustration components.

### Styling

Follow the [CSS and Tailwind guidelines](_internal/css.md) for styling ownership, responsive breakpoints, design tokens, and reuse.

### Product documentation

Use the docs to explain the product experience and its contracts.
Keep implementation tasks in the internal planning material.
Keep release availability accurate in the installation guide.

Before handing off visual changes, inspect desktop and narrow layouts, light and dark themes, keyboard navigation, and search in a production preview.
Run `bun run check` to verify website/tooling formatting, lint, types, tests, the static build, and links between built pages. The Go build tests also compile the copyable rule examples through the current resolver and renderer.

### Link checks

`bun run check` checks links and anchors within the built site, including absolute URLs to `code-rules.fabricahq.com`. To also check external links, run `bun run docs:build && bun run docs:links:all` from the repository root.

The Documentation workflow runs both checks on every push and pull request. A broken link fails the workflow, even when the change does not touch a Markdown file.

The external check follows redirects and verifies anchors in static HTML. It permits only public network destinations, including after redirects. It fetches each URL once, retries temporary failures, and exits with an error listing the source pages and failing links. HTTP errors (including access denials), timeouts, and oversized HTML responses fail the check; they are never silently treated as valid links.

Checks cover rendered hyperlinks, including linked downloads. URLs in code examples are not hyperlinks. Email links and other non-HTTP schemes are skipped. Fragments in non-HTML downloads are not checked; anchors created only by client-side JavaScript cannot be verified. Do not add broad exclusions to hide a failed check: fix the link, use a stable destination, or retry if the site is temporarily unavailable.
