# Release policy

Release Planner's agent reads this file before every release. Treat the public contract below as what users depend on, and flag uncertainty instead of inventing compatibility guarantees.

## Breaking changes

A change is breaking when it changes any of these in a way that forces users to change their configuration, rules, scripts, or workflow:

- Command names, flags, arguments, and exit codes
- JSON output from `--json`, which scripts parse
- Project and library configuration files and their keys
- The rule library format: rule, group, and library files, and the IDs other projects reference
- Library releases: change notes in `changes/`, `release/<number>` tags, and the release record in their tag messages, which other Code Rules versions read
- The exported API of the `github.com/fabricahq/code-rules/coderules` Go package, which other tools import to read libraries
- Vendored source records (`vendor/<source>/_source.json`), which projects commit
- Generated files, including `generated/provenance.json`
- The managed project README format (`.code-rules/README.md`); see [Choosing a version](#choosing-a-version)
- Supported platforms, and the release archive names, `SHA256SUMS`, and attestation signer that the standalone installer, the Homebrew tap, and generated library CI workflows depend on

Internal refactors, CI changes, and website-only changes are not part of the contract.

## Choosing a version

Versions follow [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/), with Git tags `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. The CLI reports the same version without the `v`. Prereleases use a suffix such as `v0.2.0-rc.1`. Release tags never carry build metadata.

Before 1.0.0:

- Minor: any breaking change or new feature. Always document breaking changes; 0.x is not permission to hide them.
- Patch: compatible fixes, documentation, and internal changes

From 1.0.0:

- Major: any breaking change
- Minor: compatible new features
- Patch: compatible fixes, documentation, and internal changes

A change to the managed project README format is always breaking: a minor release before 1.0.0, a major release from 1.0.0. The notes describe the format change, and that `code-rules project build`, `code-rules project sync`, `code-rules project update`, and `code-rules project init` replace an older, unedited guide with the one bundled in the new version but refuse to overwrite a manually edited guide.

## Who reads the release notes

Readers:

- Developers and teams who install the `code-rules` CLI to adopt rules in their projects
- Authors of rule libraries, who care about changes to the library format and authoring commands
- Developers of tools, such as catalogs, that read libraries with the `github.com/fabricahq/code-rules/coderules` Go package

## Order of the release notes

The notes present changes in this order, leaving out any with nothing to say:

1. New features
2. Improvements
3. Bug fixes
4. Breaking changes

## Always and never

- Always also call out a breaking change in a sentence near the start of the notes, so readers can't miss it.
- Always give migration steps for a breaking change, with the commands or before-and-after examples readers need. Until Code Rules is publicly announced, summarize breaking changes in a sentence instead, and say that upgrade instructions are omitted because Code Rules is in initial development.
- Always credit external contributors by GitHub handle.
- Never present internal refactors, CI changes, or website-only changes as new CLI features.
- Never mention dependency updates unless they fix a security issue.

## Release pipeline

[build-release.yml](../.github/workflows/build-release.yml) builds the release files on the release pull request, and fails when their names differ from the ones the contract above lists.

After a stable release publishes, the `downstream` job runs **Update Code Rules** (`update-code-rules.yml`) in [fabricahq/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/fabricahq/homebrew-tap). Prereleases don't update the formula. The job authenticates through **Fabrica Homebrew Releaser**, a shared App installed only on the tap with Actions write and Metadata read permissions. Its credentials are the `DOWNSTREAM_APP_CLIENT_ID` variable and `DOWNSTREAM_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secret in this repository's `downstream` environment. The tap's own publishing App key never leaves the tap. [CR-7](https://linear.app/ohmygoshjosh/issue/CR-7/replace-shared-homebrew-trigger-keys-with-an-oidc-dispatch-service) tracks replacing shared keys with an OIDC dispatch service.

If the dispatch fails, use **Re-run failed jobs** on the Release run. If the tap update fails, fix the reported problem and run the tap's **Update Code Rules** workflow manually. A tap failure doesn't change the published release.
